# CD-berry
Solid State emulation with a Raspberry Pi Zero

# Rationale
When upgrading BIOS firmware on servers (e.g. Dell R<number> servers) sometimes the only way to perform these is using a CD-rom. Often a bootable USB-stick is not possible, because the OS applied by the software (e.g. Dell Repository Manager) creating firmware upgrade deployments expects to mount a CD-rom. An USB-stick just won't work.
To solve this a normal CD could be burned, but well, those are not that common any more and also CD-burners are becoming more and more an exception.
My long-term solution is a Raspberry Pi Zero emulation a CD-rom player with an USB connection.
